"""Executive synthesis layer for v0.9.3.

This version is intentionally different from the Executive Summary. The summary
answers: "what is the current readout?" This engine answers: "what is new,
where is the edge, what is the gap, and what should be watched next?"

It derives second-order intelligence from the existing return table, channel
summaries, catalyst table, technical read, capital-flow read, and activation
state. No new data source is claimed in this build.
